# Phase 2 – Core Repository Structure

In this phase, I designed and implemented the foundational
repository structure for the Unified Enterprise GenAI Router.

Key decisions:
- Separated task analysis, policy logic, routing, and model wrappers
- Introduced strict data contracts (Task, PolicyDecision, ModelResponse)
- Designed model-agnostic interfaces
- Added artifacts folder for architectural traceability

Outcome:
A clean, extensible, enterprise-grade AI platform skeleton
ready for policy-driven routing and multi-model orchestration.
