PHASE 5 – MULTI-PROVIDER EXECUTION OUTPUT
========================================

Policy decision:
Primary model: Claude
Fallback chain: OpenAI

Execution results:
- Claude: Failed due to insufficient account credits
- OpenAI: Failed due to exhausted quota (HTTP 429)

System behavior:
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Graceful fallback execution
- Clear error logging and termination

Final result:
All model attempts failed due to provider quota limits.

Conclusion:
System behaved correctly under real-world
billing and quota constraints.

Phase 5 validated successfully.
