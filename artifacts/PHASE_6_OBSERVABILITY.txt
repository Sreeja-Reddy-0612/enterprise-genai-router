PHASE 6 — OBSERVABILITY & AUDITABILITY

Goal:
Add visibility into system behavior through metrics, traces, and a monitoring UI.

What is included:
- Metrics tracking (total requests, per-model usage, failures)
- Execution traces with request-level details
- API endpoints for observability data
- Frontend dashboard for real-time monitoring

Core Files:
- app/observability/metrics.py
- app/observability/trace_store.py
- app/router/model_router.py
- app/api/server.py
- frontend/index.html

Endpoints:
- POST /execute
- GET /metrics
- GET /traces

Important Notes:
- Metrics and traces work even if all models fail
- Failures are expected and observable
- Model availability is not required to complete this phase

Status:
PHASE 6 COMPLETE
