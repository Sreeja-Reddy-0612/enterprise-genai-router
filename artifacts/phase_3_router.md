# Phase 3 – Model Router & Wrapper Interfaces

In this phase, I implemented the execution layer of the platform.

Key components:
- Abstract BaseModel interface
- Provider-specific wrapper implementations
- Central model router that executes policy decisions

Design principles:
- Vendor isolation
- Policy–execution separation
- Explainable execution with policy traces

Outcome:
The system can now execute AI tasks end-to-end
from policy decision to model response.
